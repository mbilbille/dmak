*For the sake of simplicity, "Draw Me A Kanji" is shortened to dmak*

## Usage
Using dmak.js is easy, a lot easier than writing kanjis, trust me!

**Prerequisite**  
To simplify all the work with SVG, we use the cool JavaScript library *Raphaël* ➲ [Download](http://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/raw/master/raphael-min.js)  
*and no worries this is the ONLY dependency.*

Once you are all set, include both `raphael.js` and `dmak.js` files in your HTML file.

Up to you to use either:

#### Pure JavaScript
```html
<div id="draw"></div>
<script>
  var dmak = new Dmak('電車', {
    'element' : "draw"
  });
</script>
```

#### or the jQuery plugin  

```html
<div id="draw"></div>
<script>
    // That's it!
    $("#draw").dmak('電車');
</script>
```
**NOTE:** *You need to include the additional `jquery.dmak.js` file*

## Options
Dmak.js comes with a whole set of options to alter the way it behaves. Here is an explicit list of all parameters available to you followed by their default value.

* `uri` - path to the SVG files folder. `""`
* `skipLoad` - skip SVG files loading. `false`
* `autoplay` - start drawing as soon as all SVG files are loaded. `true`
* `height` - height in pixels of a single paper surface. `109`
* `width` - width in pixels of a single paper surface. `109`
* `step` - positive integer which defines the speed of the drawing. `0.03`
* `element` - DOM element or its ID which is going to be a parent for drawing surface. `"draw"`
* `stroke.animated` - enable or disable stroke animation. `true`
* `stroke.attr.active` - currently drawn stroke color. `"#F92672"`
* `stroke.attr.stroke` - stroke color. `"#272822"`
* `stroke.attr.stroke-width` - stroke width in pixels. `3`
* `stroke.attr.stroke-linecap` - ["butt", "square", "round"]. `"round`
* `stroke.attr.stroke-linejoin` - ["bevel", "round", "miter"]. `"round`
* `grid.show` - show or hide gridlines. `true`
* `grid.attr.stroke` - grid color. `"#CCCCCC"`
* `grid.attr.stroke-width` - grid width in pixels. `0.5`
* `grid.attr.stroke-dasharray` - ["", "-", ".", "-.", "-..", ". ", "- ", "--", "- .", "--.", "--.."]. `"--"`
* `loaded` - callback function which is executed when all SVG files are fully loaded
* `erased` - callback function which is executed when a stroke is erased
* `drew` - callback function which is executed when a stroke is drawn
